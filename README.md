Shopping cart project - Complete with feature test.
```
Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of any
number of items taken from a predetermined list. Each item should be priced
individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

The requirements for the system are as follows:

As a shopper
So I know how much an item costs
I would like to be able to see its price

As a shopper
So that I can buy an item
I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout

As a shopper
So that I know if I have made a mistake
I should be informed if I attempt to buy an item which is not available

As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items

As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)

As a shopper
So that I am not left out of pocket
I would like to receive the correct change once I have completed my transaction
```
